### Chapter 20

Chapter 7: The Breach

The night air was thick with an electric tension as the sleek silhouette of the Aegis, an advanced stealth aircraft, cut silently through the clouds. Its matte black skin absorbed light, making it nearly invisible against the starless sky. Inside, the cockpit was alive with a soft phosphorescent glow from the array of holographic displays that floated before Captain Elara Myles.

"Approaching target coordinates," announced SYN, the ship's AI, its voice calm yet somehow tinged with anticipation. The display in front of Elara flickered, synchronizing with the satellite feed, overlaying thermal images over a three-dimensional map of the sprawling complex below.

Elara’s eyes, reflecting the greenish hue of the data streams, scanned the information rapidly. "SYN, initiate cloaking sequence. Prepare for descent."

"As you command, Captain," SYN responded. The ship’s exterior panels shifted, initiating the quantum cloaking mechanism. A faint hum vibrated through the hull, the sound of cutting-edge technology manipulating the very fabric of visibility.

Below, the Lazarus Facility sprawled like a behemoth in the secluded Argyre Planitia on Mars. Owned by the enigmatic Tyrell Corporation, it was rumored to be developing a weapon capable of altering time sequences. Tonight, Elara and her team were going to ensure it never saw the light of day.

The Aegis descended, whisper-quiet, towards an unguarded section of the complex marked by SYN. Elara turned to her right, where her second-in-command, Lieutenant Hark, was gearing up. His face was a mask of focus as he checked his pulse rifle and cloaking gear.

"Remember, we grab the prototype, scrub the data, and exfil. No heroics," Elara said, her voice stern but low.

"Understood, Captain," Hark replied, his eyes never leaving his equipment.

As the aircraft touched down, barely stirring the red Martian dust, the door slid open with a hiss. The team, clad in reactive armor suits, moved out with spectral precision, blending into the shadows.

They infiltrated the facility through a maintenance hatch, their movements synchronized and silent. The corridors inside were sterile and white, illuminated by the occasional flicker of an overhead neon light. Elara led the group, her senses heightened, every shadow a potential threat.

They reached the laboratory without incident, accessing it with a security cipher stolen days earlier. Inside, the prototype—a device resembling a large, intricate clock encased in a crystal shell—sat in the center of the room, an eerie blue light pulsating from its core.

Hark was securing the perimeter when an alarm blared suddenly, the sound jarringly loud in the sterile environment. "We've got company!" he shouted, just as heavily armed guards poured into the room.

"Cover me!" Elara yelled, diving toward the prototype. Blasts from energy weapons sizzled past, close enough to singe. She worked her decryption device frantically, bypassing the locks on the prototype while Hark and the others returned fire, their shots precise, meant to incapacitate, not kill.

"Almost got it!" Elara gritted her teeth, her fingers flying over the holographic interface. With a triumphant beep, the device unlocked, the crystal shell folding back like the petals of a flower.

She grabbed the prototype, tucking it securely into her pack
