### Chapter 6

**Chapter 7: Breach in the Void**

The eerie silence of space was shattered by the relentless beeping of the alarm at Station Delta, one of the frontier outposts orbiting the ice giant, Neptune. Red emergency lights painted the corridors in a sinister hue as the crew scrambled to respond to the latest crisis.

Jack O'Malley, a grizzled veteran of space wars and now the chief security officer on Station Delta, was thrown from his bunk. His heart pounded as he pulled on his suit, the fabric cold and stiff against his skin. He didn't need the blaring alarms to know something was catastrophically wrong; the way the station shuddered spoke volumes. 

"Status report!" Jack barked into his comm link as he sealed his helmet, his voice steady despite the adrenaline that surged through his veins.

"Sir, we've got a breach in Section 19! Hull integrity is compromised, and the auto-seal function is offline!" Ensign Lila Santos responded, her voice a mixture of panic and determination.

"Damn it!" Jack cursed, sprinting down the twisting metal hallways. His magnetic boots clanked against the grated floors, each step a jarring reminder of the peril they were in. Above him, pipes hissed and conduits sparked, creating a hellish tapestry of light and sound.

He arrived at the command center, where Captain Helena Myles was coordinating the response efforts. The room was a flurry of activity, with personnel tapping rapidly on holographic interfaces, projecting 3D schematics of the station and the damage it had sustained.

"Jack, there!" Helena pointed to a rotating hologram showing a gaping hole in the station's exterior. "We suspect it's not just a micrometeorite impact. It could be an intentional breach."

His eyes narrowed, scanning the data streams flowing across the display. "You think this is an attack? By who? Everyone’s at the peace talks."

"That's what we need to find out," she replied, her expression grim. "But first, we need to seal that breach. We're losing oxygen and every second counts."

Clutching his plasma cutter, Jack nodded and turned to assemble his team. They equipped themselves with high-tech gear, including propulsion packs that would allow them to maneuver in zero-gravity environments.

As they approached Section 19, the damage was worse than Jack had imagined. The outer hull was peeled open like the skin of an orange, exposing the innards of the station to the merciless vacuum of space. Around the edges of the rupture, the metal was not just torn—it was melted, suggesting the use of an advanced thermal lance.

"Look sharp, team," Jack warned, his voice echoing through their helmet radios. "This smells like sabotage. Eyes peeled for any more surprises."

Using their propulsion packs, they navigated through the debris field surrounding the breach. The void outside was a tapestry of swirling blues and whites of Neptune, a silent giant watching the drama unfold.

Just as they were setting up the portable sealing unit, a shadow detached itself from the wreckage. A figure in a stealth suit, almost invisible against the backdrop of space, floated towards them with a menacing grace.

"Contact! Hostile!" shouted Jack, drawing his particle beam sidearm. The figure didn't hesitate, raising a weapon and firing a stream of ionized particles.

The crew ducked behind the bulkheads as the beams s
