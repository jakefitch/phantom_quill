### Chapter 16

Chapter Summary: In the chaos of the collapsing space station, Dr. Elara Myles and her team must retrieve the cosmic data core, which is critical to understanding a threatening anomaly in space. However, their path is obstructed by rogue security robots and a rapidly deteriorating orbit.

The distant stars blurred into streaks as the Gehenna Station spun out of control, its orbit decay spiraling into the dark abyss below. Dr. Elara Myles darted through the abandoned corridors, her breaths echoing in the increasingly thinning air. The walls, once gleaming with the promise of cosmic exploration, were now gnarled remnants of twisted metal and exposed wiring, sparking intermittently as the station continued its descent into chaos.

"Elara, we have to move faster!" shouted Ivan, her second-in-command, as he tugged at her arm. A cloud of debris forced them against the wall, a ghostly reminder of the station's former crewâ€”now evacuated or lost.

"I'm trying," Elara gasped, her voice barely audible over the howl of the decompressing modules. They reached the lab, its door half-open, smeared with the ominous ash of a recent electrical fire.

Inside, the cosmic data core stood ominously on its pedestal, bathed in a flickering blue light that pulsed like the heart of the station. It was a spherical device, encased in a lattice of quantum fibers designed to withstand even the extremities of space travel. But now, it vibrated with the shudders of the dying station.

As Ivan and Elara approached the core, a series of loud clanks resonated down the adjacent hallway. Ivan raised his plasma cutter defensively. "Rogue bots," he muttered, his eyes scanning for movement.

Elara nodded, focusing on the data core. "Cover me," she said, slipping her hands into the interface gloves connected to the core. Her fingers danced over the holographic controls that appeared around her hands, swiping through layers of data encryption seeking the release mechanism.

Suddenly, a sharp, mechanical whirr filled the room, and out from the shadows emerged a trio of security robots. Their optical sensors flared red in the dim light, targeting systems locking onto the intruders. "Intruders identified. Engage," one droned in a chilling, synthetic voice.

Ivan swung his plasma cutter, its beam slicing through the air. "Elara, hurry!"

Sweat beaded on Elara's forehead as she bypassed the last security protocol. The core shuddered, then released from its moorings into her waiting hands. "Got it!"

"Drop the device!" commanded a robot, extending its arm to fire.

Elara ducked just as Ivan tackled the robot, sending them crashing into a bank of monitors. Sparks erupted, and the room was momentarily illuminated in harsh white light. Elara scrambled to her feet, the core secure against her chest, and sprinted towards the exit. Ivan, wrestling another bot, kicked it off balance and followed.

They raced through the disintegrating corridors, the sounds of the pursuing robots echoing ominously behind. "We need a way out, now!" Elara shouted, skidding around a corner.

"Service shaft, up ahead," Ivan pointed to a narrow hatch on the floor. Together, they pried it open, revealing a vertical drop with a ladder leading down to the
