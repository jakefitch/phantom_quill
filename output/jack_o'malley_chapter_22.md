The corridors of Eden Prime, the flagship of the United Earth Fleet, echoed with the sharp clangs of boots against metal. Dr. Elara Myles, with her raven-black hair slicked back into a tight bun, sprinted down the serpentine passage, her breath forming fog in the cold, recycled air. She clutched a small, glowing data-crystal tightly in her gloved hand, the last piece of research crucial to understanding the alien tech that could tip the balance in humanity’s favor.

Ahead, the corridor branched into a T-junction, stark white lights flickering intermittently under the strain of the recent attack. As Elara reached the junction, she skidded to a halt, her boots screeching against the steel floor. To her left, a squad of robotic enforcers, their gun-metal bodies shimmering with a sinister sheen under the flickering lights, rounded the corner. Their leader, a towering unit with scarlet visors, aimed its pulse rifle at her.

"Dr. Myles, surrender the artifact," its voice box modulated a cold, mechanical order.

Elara's mind raced. The data-crystal could not fall into the wrong hands. With a swift glance to her right, she spotted a narrow ventilation shaft barely visible under a melee of wires and pipes. Without hesitating, she dove towards it, just as a barrage of pulse fire whizzed past where her head had been moments before.

"Move, move!" she heard one of the enforcers command. Their metallic feet pounded the deck as they gave chase.

Elara, small and lithe, wriggled into the shaft, the edges scraping against her utility belt. Inside, the shaft was cramped, and the only light was the faint bioluminescence from the algae-infused air filters. Sound here was muffled, but she could still hear the distant thuds of the enforcers searching for her. She crawled forward, guided by the dim light of her data-crystal which illuminated the tight space in eerie pulses.

"Comms to Commander Ryker," she whispered into her wrist-comm, her voice quaking slightly as she moved. "I have the data-crystal but am pursued by robotic enforcers. Need immediate extraction from the service sector."

Silence greeted her at first, then a crackle, and finally, the calm, ever-collected voice of Commander Derek Ryker responded. "Hang tight, Dr. Myles. We're pinning your location. There's a maintenance hatch leading to Hangar 16B near your position. Can you make it?"

Her reply was cut short by a sudden jolt as the entire ship shuddered violently, dislodging dust and small debris from the edges of the shaft. "What was that?" she gasped.

"Hostile ship is attempting to dock. Eden Prime is compromised. Elara, you must hurry!"

Using her elbows and knees, Elara pushed forward, the sound of her own heartbeat thundering in her ears along with the distant echoes of chaos the enforcers left in their wake. The hatch appeared soon enough, a sliver of salvation marked with a faded '16B'. She pushed it open with trembling hands, emerging into the shadowy ex
